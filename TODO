do i have to track the permissions?
  files to load could copy their permissions from its correspondent
  destination. and the only executable in this repo is load.sh
then, i think it's not necessary to track them.
#TODO: do not track permissions

#TODO: remove .netrwhist from the repo
#there is actually 2 .netrwhist
